### dfetch is just my rust learning project.

The main focus of this app is on **execution speed**. `(neofetch is painfully slow)` <br>
However, maintaining clean code is also a priority.. <br>

I'm trying to minimize the use of external libraries where the required functionality isn't complex.

I don't plan to add a configuration file or anything like that. <br>
**Everything works as it is**, and for new features, it should **be modified the sources**. <br>
I think it's justified.

btw, i'll be happy if somebody send some cool ascii cat arts in issues :point_right::point_left:
