### dfetch is just my rust learning project

The main focus of this app is on **execution speed**. `(neofetch is painfully slow)` <br>
I'm trying to minimize the use of external libraries where the required functionality isn't complex. <br>
However, maintaining clean code is also a priority.. <br>

### supports the following package managers
I plan to add support for each

- xbps ( [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) )
- pacman ( [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) )


btw, i'll be happy if somebody send some cool ascii cat arts in issues :point_right::point_left:
